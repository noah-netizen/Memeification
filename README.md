# memeification

For this project I wanted to focus especially on the seemingly omnipresent meme-culture that is present on the internet, and pay patronage to the real OG memes that played a significant role in my sense of humor. I was able to generate memes from the sub-reddit r/ComedyArchaeology using an open-source API from D3vd on github (https://github.com/D3vd), and wanted to learn how to implement audio into my website, so I had to go with the classic Bruh Sound effect #2.
